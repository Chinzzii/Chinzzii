## Hi there, I'm Chinmay Singhania 👋

I am currently pursuing a **Master of Computer Science** degree at *North Carolina State University*, with an expected graduation date in *May 2025*. My coursework has included subjects like *Adanced Cloud Architecture*, *Design and Analysis of Algorithms*, *Database Management Systems*, and *Software Engineering*, etc.

Passionate about technology and innovation, I am actively seeking **2025 Full-Time Software Engineering Roles in the US** to enhance my technical knowledge and gain valuable experience with a reputed firm.

During my Bachelor's in *Computer Engineering* at *Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering*, I delved into a wide range of topics, including *Cloud Computing*, *Artificial Intelligence*, and *Machine Learning*. I have hands-on experience in developing various kinds of projects.

I am certified in various areas, including *DevOps*, *AWS*, *Flutter*, and *Blockchain*. My leadership experiences include being a member of the *Social Media and External Affairs Cell* of *CESA (Computer Engineering Student Association)* which is my undergraduate college's ACM Student Chapter, and receiving the *Award in Higher Studies and Entrepreneurship of the year 2022-2023* from my undergraduate college.
